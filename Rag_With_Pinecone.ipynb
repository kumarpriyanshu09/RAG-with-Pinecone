            "Answer: {'answer': \"According to the video, LangGraph is open source software provided by the same company as LangChain and is designed specifically for implementing multi-agent systems. Unlike LangChain, which is suitable for simple and linear workflows, LangGraph is useful for workflows involving multiple agents, node-like knowledge graphs, and complex relations. A key feature is its capability to easily implement 'human-in-the-loop' concepts, such as including human feedback in workflows. In a multi-agent system, agents can be coordinated to achieve a set goal while maintaining memory and state, with LangGraph providing tools and classes to handle different types of memory (short-term, long-term, episodic) and maintain state across agents.\", 'citations': [\"Lang chain is for like workflow. It's like kind of linear things, right? One by one, like for very simple workflow, Lang chain is useful. In case of Lang graph, it is for multi agent system. Okay, multi agent system involving like node kind of knowledge graph, that kind of relations. And it has a lot of unique features like say for example, that Lang graph libraries are allowing us to implement a human in the loop that concept very easily.\", 'implementing that workflow, a Lang graph will be more useful. Okay, and for human in the loop implementation for implementing multi agent systems, a Lang graph will be useful. And one more thing is that memory maintenance, okay. So maintaining memory like memory in the sense there are different kinds of memory.', 'So basically, a long-grave is useful for maintaining state, okay. That is the core concept in this agent-age system. So long-grave, I will be showing you with one simple demo.']}\n"
